        #region Set transaction isolation levels

        /*
        Read Uncommitted: The lowest level of isolation, allows transactions to read uncommitted data from other transactions. This can lead to dirty reads and other issues.

        Read Committed: Transactions can only read data that has been committed by other transactions. This level avoids dirty reads but can still experience other isolation problems.

        Repeatable Read: Transactions can only read data that was committed before their execution, and all reads are repeatable. This prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads, but may still experience phantom reads.

        Serializable: The highest level of isolation, ensuring that transactions are completely isolated from one another. This can lead to increased lock contention, potentially hurting performance.

        Snapshot: This isolation level uses row versioning to avoid locks, providing consistency without impeding concurrency.
